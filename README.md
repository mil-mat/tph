# Tuya Plug Hotkeys
This simple Java application facilitates the use of a keyboard to toggle Tuya smart-home plugs.
* To use it, simply download the latest version and double-click it.
  *(I recommend you do this in a separate folder to give it space to create files)*

* **(windows)** For launch on system startup, press `Win + R`, then type `shell:startup`. After pressing enter, a folder should open. Drop a shortcut of the JAR file into here.

**Note:** This is a project that I created in about 3 days as a personal utility. This is not meant to be a showcase nor is it likely that it is bug-free.  
Tested on Windows 10.
